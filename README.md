# BotanixTestnet

Automated Faucet Coin Claiming for Botanix Testnet

## Overview

BotanixTestnet is a Python-based project designed to automate claiming testnet tokens for the Botanix EVM-compatible Spiderchain built on Bitcoin. Botanix Labs is pioneering Bitcoin Layer 2 scaling with its Spiderchain, an EVM-equivalent Layer 2 secured by decentralized multisig wallets (Orchestrator nodes) and leveraging Proof-of-Stake consensus while settling on Bitcoinâ€™s base layer.

This repository provides scripts to help developers and testers easily acquire testnet coins from the Botanix faucet and interact with the Spiderchain testnet.

## About Botanix

- EVM-equivalent Layer 2 network built on Bitcoin  
- Uses Spiderchain: decentralized multisig wallets securing bridged BTC  
- Enables Ethereum-compatible dApp development on Bitcoin  
- Proof-of-Stake consensus with Bitcoin finality  
- Supports bridging BTC on and off the Layer 2 chain

## Features

- Automated faucet claiming of Botanix testnet tokens  
- Python scripts for easy setup and usage  
- Supports testing and development on the Spiderchain Bitcoin L2  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/piobox2001/BotanixTestnet.git
cd BotanixTestnet
```

2. Install required Python packages as above.

3. Configure your testnet wallet address in the script (`botax.py`) or as instructed.

### Usage

Run the faucet claiming script:

```
python botax.py
```

This will interact with the Botanix faucet to request testnet tokens.
